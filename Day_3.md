## Day-3: Exploring Cadence Calculator and BGR Circuit Analysis
The objective of Day-3 was to explore and understand the Calculator features in the Cadence tool for extracting and evaluating circuit parameters, and to design a Bandgap Reference (BGR) circuit. The day also focused on performing DC analysis, calculating the PTAT and CTAT slopes, and verifying the temperature-independent reference voltage behavior of the BGR circuit.


### Steps to Use Calculator and Do Measurements in Cadence

* Open **Virtuoso** and load the schematic and testbench
* Run the required **analysis** in ADE
* Go to **Tools → Calculator**
* Select the required **function** (voltage/current/expression)
* Pick the **node or device** from the schematic
* Click **Evaluate / Plot** to obtain results
* Calculate **PTAT and CTAT slopes (ΔV/ΔT)** using temperature sweep results
