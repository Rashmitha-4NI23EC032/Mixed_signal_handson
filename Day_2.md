## BGR Circuit design in Cadence Tool
## Purpose of the session:
<p>The primary objective of today’s session was to develop a technical understanding of analog circuit design methodologies using the Cadence design environment, with a focused study on Bandgap Reference (BGR) circuits. The session covered schematic capture, pre-layout simulation, and performance analysis of analog circuits within Cadence. Emphasis was placed on analyzing different BGR topologies to understand the generation of temperature-independent and supply-insensitive reference voltages through the combination of PTAT and CTAT components. This knowledge forms a fundamental requirement for the design of precision CMOS analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, where stable biasing and reference generation are critical.</p>
